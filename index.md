This project was a seminar work I did with 2 friends in my 6th semester for a course at my university. Together, we programmed our own version of the game Tetris. For the GUI we used the [Qt framework](https://www.qt.io/product/framework) .

If you want to download our game, please click [here](https://github.com/FelixWeichselgartner/Tetris/releases/tag/1.0.1) (This link leads you to my friends GitHub- Repository where we safed all files and captured the changes).

Here is a first look at the singleplayer:

This is the menu:

Furthermore we implemented a multiplayer with a competitive feature. Whenever one player succedes in removing 5 lines the other player gets a line inserted (with a hole) from the bottom.

The whole project is based on [TetrisCli](https://github.com/FelixWeichselgartner/Tetris/tree/Cli) that we programmed in our 3rd semester by using the Cli.

This is how the old program looked like:

In the console we were not able to get a proper framerate (as console prints are very slow) and our squares were not actual squares and rather rectangles. That's why we programmed the newer version TetrisQt which I explained above.
